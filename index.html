  <h3>Introduction Sample</h3>
  <p>• ISMN MUSIC/MUSICAL NOTATION/ANNOTATION – In some ways the so-called inabove. Both in terms of captions are expected to be sufficient. But for this time in terms of MusicalNotation. We always expect participation in musicits production or music release distribution. But this will be different because of the thingpublishing for ISMN will fall into the full education category. Because it is relatedwith note-level writing or annotation in music.</p>

<div id="Sample #1" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Sample 1</h3>
  <p>• MUSIC DISTRIBUTION – Every piece wants to be tasted and produce its own satisfactionfor every work that has been produced whether it is from any genre / genre of music that is increate.always we expect more value than what has been done. Sofrom that RETUNERECORD suggests and at the same time in every work made Inits music production is capable of being distributed individually or commercially for anyrelease in terms of physical as well as the current digital era that is advancing.</p>
</div>

<div id="Sample #2" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Sample 2</h3>
  <p>• MUSIC PRODUCTION – Through this procedure encourages each creator of the work and invitesseveral levels of local and non-local art workers to contribute both inpaid or unpaid. Depends on what RETUNERECORD expectsin every activity. It's good that we support against art creators who havestrong desire and has a degree in the creation of works for commercial or forhimself.because every work made is the result of the work itself for himselfand for others.</p>
